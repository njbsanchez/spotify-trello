# ShipIt54 - Trello + Spotify Power Up ðŸŽ§

Once seen primarily as a project management tool, Trello has transformed into more than just a tool that gets a task or project from point A to B. Today, Trello is used by millions as a unique place where work can be done and managed. Accessing Confluence, Jira, JWM, Atlasâ€¦all products can be used and accessed (or on the roadmap to be) while staying within your Trello board so that the user can remain in the tool that best serves them.

Trello is the mission control hub for so many, letsâ€™s continue adding on to this experience by enabling apps like Spotify and Apple Music into oneâ€™s board. Imagine, accessing your music player of choice all without leaving your place of work. Limit wasted time and remain on the tools that help serve you and your needs.

### Why are we doing it?
Optimizing Trello as the place where all customers start their day is the reason this project makes so much sense. In the future, we can look to enabling podcast apps, etc. Keeping one's work within a set board allows for the users to really feel like this is their personal space as well as create other boards etc. with music to help set the mood for future meetings, projects, etc.

### What will success look like?
Successful integration would look like a user having the ability to search a song, playlist, etc. all within Trello without having to leave the board itself. Skipping and pausing songs would be possible all while staying within one's board.
